# chesterfield

An ergonomic, strongly typed CouchDB client in Rust.

This library includes both synchronous and asynchronous APIs for the programmer who wants to have it all.

Couldn't find a decent, maintained CouchDB client in Rust. Also I wanted async. So i rolled my own.

This is still in active development, in the sense that I add things when I need them, and fix bugs when they affect
me directly.

Until this gets slightly closer to stable the updates to the release on Crates.io will be a lot more sporadic than the github updates.

Would be thrilled to have a couple more sets of eyes and keyboards chipping away at this. climb aboard.
